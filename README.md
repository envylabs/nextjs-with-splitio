This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It adds [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for application state and an integration with [Split.io](https://www.split.io/) for loading treatments as feature flags.
